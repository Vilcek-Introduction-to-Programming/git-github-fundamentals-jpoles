# Homework assignment

##: What did I learn about GitHub and what am I still confused about?

I learned how GitHub can be useful for ensuring rigor by directly sharing information/protocols/data with collaborators, or just by having it readily available in case someone attempting to replicate, assess, utilize/cite (e.g., meta analysis) the study needed the raw data. I also learned how to utilize some key features such as pull request, through which you can request to edit the given repository, if created by a collaborator, for example.

I'm still a bit confused on creating markdown files; to create this one I opened the original .md file in text editor, duplicated it, and then uploaded it, but I know there is a more efficient/better accepted way (by cloning the repository, I believe?), which I couldn't quite grasp from the demonstration in the lecture.

## : Wilson et al. on computational reproducibility

One practice recommended by Wilson et al. to optimize computational reproducibility is collaboration. GitHub is a useful tool for this because files can be efficiently shared between collaborators. Overviews and to-do lists, as recommended in the article, can be detailed in the ReadMe file, or made into separate files. Collaborators can submit pull requests to alert others of progress (e.g., making edits to the to-do list to communicate that a task has been completed). GitHub also allows for good data management and organization, to ensure that raw data is never lost (with less effort than through other approaches, perhaps). This will make the project citable, as recommended in the article, if the citing authors were to need raw data (as in the example of a meta-analysis that I described above).
